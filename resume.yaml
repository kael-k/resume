    about_me: 
      - |
          I have always been passionate about IT: I started doing development at 14 years old; after completing high school, I
          enrolled in 2015 at the Computer Engineering course at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia.

      - |
          In my second year, I moved to Modena, continuing my studies and supporting myself by working at a McDonald’s, 
          helping me build resilience and adaptability skills. Between the end of my second year and the beginning of my third year I got my first job in IT as a full-remote web developer.

          After graduating in 2018, I moved to Milan to continue my studies at Politecnico di Milano. During those years I had
          the opportunity to gain a lot of work experience and to self-study, as well as meeting other enthusiasts and professionals in the sector.  
          Thanks to the Politecnico Linux User Group POuL, I had the chance to meet very skilled people in various areas of IT, whom I had the chance to learn a lot from.

          Around 2021 I decided to suspend my Master’s Degree in Computer Engineering to continue with my professional
          career and in July 2021 I started working as a freelancer.

          In my free time I like to read. I also love travelling and hiking in the mountains.
